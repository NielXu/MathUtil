Version 0.1.2:

Added left riemann sum, right riemann sum, mid point riemann sum and the trapezoid rule to calculate the
integral. Added test cases 1-4 for Calculus class, but still need more test cases.
Fixed Sigma class, now the Sigma calculation will use BigDecimal to store the boundaries and increment in
order to reduce the accuracy loss.
